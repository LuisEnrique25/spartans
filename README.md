# Spartans Fan-Page

Project about characters from the Halo saga that consists of randomly showing a card with information about a Spartan.

In this project designed with React, the useState hook was mainly used to make card changes with a button, passing the information to the different components that make up the app, I also used conditional rendering to a lesser extent.

Regarding the CSS, I used some animation to change title color and rotate an icon when the hover pseudo-class is applied to it, I also made the main card show one side by default and with the hover pseudo-class it show the other side using the transform property.
